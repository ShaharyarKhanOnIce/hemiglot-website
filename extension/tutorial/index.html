                    <p>You may have reached a limit to what you can do on Duolingo. Serious leaners
                         often use multiple sources to learn a language. Duolingo does not allow you
                         to easily export or download your vocabulary or words list consisting of the 
                         words you've learned. To practice your words on Duolingo, you have to upgrade 
                         to one of their premium plans such as Duolingo Super or Duolingo Max.<br><br>
                         But with the Hemiglot Browser Extension, you can download your words for Free
                         and super-charge your language learning by uploading your words to sites like 
                         Quizlet or Ankicard.
                    </p>

                        <h3 class="some-space">1. Setting up the Hemiglot Extension</h3>
                        <p>First off, you will have to install the Hemiglot Browser Extension on your 
                            computer. You could do that from the Chrome Web Store. <span><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hogonccaonkhgemjobaaldpahemijmin?utm_source=item-share-cb">Click here</a></span> 
                            to install the extension.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>After installing the extension, click your extensions button, which appears as 
                            a puzzle icon on the top right of your screen.
                        </p>
                        <figure><img loading="lazy" class="on-left" src="../../assets/tutorial_img_1.png" alt="Extensions button"></figure>
                        <p>You will find a list of your extensions here. Find the extension named "Hemiglot - Duolingo 
                            Vocabulary Downloader" and click the pin icon to pin it.
                        </p>
                        <figure><img loading="lazy" class="on-left" src="../../assets/tutorial_img_2.png" alt="Pinning the chrome extension"></figure>
                        <h3 class="some-space">2. Opening up Duolingo</h3>
                        <p>Open up Duolingo on your browser. Alternatively, you can open up the words tab on Duolingo from 
                            <span><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/practice-hub/words">this link</a></span> and skip straight 
                            to step #4! Its a good idea to bookmark this tab if you download your words frequently.<br><br> 
                            When you open up Duolingo, the page will look like this. Click on the 'Practice' button on the left menu.
                        </p>
                        <figure><img loading="lazy" class="on-left" src="../../assets/tutorial_img_3.png" alt="Duolingo.com home page"></figure>
                        <h3 class="some-space">Finding your Words list</h3>
                        <p>When I was fiddling around trying to find my words list, I assumed it would be in the Account section, 
                            but that isn't the case. After clicking on the 'Practice' button, your page will look like this. Click on 
                            the 'Words' button as shown.
                        </p>
                        <figure><img loading="lazy" class="on-left" src="../../assets/tutorial_img_4.png" alt="Duolingo Practice page"></figure>
                        <p>This is what your page should like. If the site looks something like this, you did everything correctly.</p>
                        <figure><img loading="lazy" class="on-left" src="../../assets/tutorial_img_5.png" alt="Duolingo Words tab"></figure>
                        <h3 class="some-space">Downloading your Words list</h3>
                        <p>Now, for the grand finale. Its time to export your words.</p>
                        <h4>4.1 Click the Hemiglot icon</h4>
                        <p>At the top right, next to the Extension 'puzzle' icon, you'll find the Hemiglot Browser Extension icon.</p>
                        <figure><img loading="lazy" class="on-left" src="../../assets/tutorial_img_6.png" alt="Hemiglot extension icon"></figure>
                        <h4>4.2 Click on the Export Button</h4>
                        <p>A popup will appear. You'll see a red button saying 'EXPORT'.</p>
                        <figure><img loading="lazy" class="on-left" src="../../assets/tutorial_img_7.png" alt="Extension popup"></figure>
                        <p class="some-space">If you see an error like this, reload the page and restart step #4</p>

                        <p>You'll see a loading icon and your words will get downloaded.</p>
                        <figure><img loading="lazy" class="on-left" src="../../assets/tutorial_img_9.png" alt="Downloading in progress"></figure>
                        <p>If you face any errors, click the 'Bug Fixes' link in the extension</p>
                    <div class="more-some-space">
                        <h2>Happy Learning!</h2>
                        <p>If the extension worked for you, consider <strong>leaving a review</strong> on the 
                            Chrome Web Store :D
