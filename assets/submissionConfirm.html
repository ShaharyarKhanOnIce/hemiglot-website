            <h3>Your email has been recorded</h3>
            <p class="container">The word 'Subscribe' consists of the Latin suffix 'Sub-' meaning 'under' or 'below'. The word 'author' is a synonym for 'scribe'.
               To 'subscribe' is to be under a scribe's or author's list, or their influence in a more superficial sense.
               <br>Thankyou for underauthoring!</p>
