                    <p>This privacy policy applies to the "Hemiglot - Duolingo Vocabulary Downloader" browser extension.<br><br>

                    <h3>Data Collection & Usage</h3>
                    <p>The "Hemiglot - Duolingo Vocabulary Downloader" browser extension <strong>does not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any 
                        personal information from its users. The extension 
                    operates entirely within the user's browser session and does not collect analytics, track browsing activity, 
                    or store information on any remote server.</p>
                    <h3>Permissions</h3>
                    <p>The browser extension requests the following permissions solely to provide its core functionality.</p>
                    <h4>Host</h4>
                    <p>The extension requests access to https://www.duolingo.com/* solely to detect when the user is on Duolingo’s 
                        website and specifically on the “Words” tab. This permission is required for the extension to scrape learned words 
                        from that page when the user chooses to export them. No other sites are accessed, and no data is stored, shared, or 
                        transmitted anywhere — all processing occurs locally on the user’s device.</p>
                    <h4>activeTab</h4>
                    <p>Used only to identify when the user is currently viewing the target page / url. 
                        It enables the extension to run its script on that active page when prompted by the user.</p>
                    <h4>downloads</h4>
                    <p>Used only when prompted by the user, to save the data read as a .txt file on 
                        the user's device. The file is created and downloaded locally.
                    </p>
                    <h3>User Control</h3>
                    <p>You can uninstall the extension or revoke permissions through your browser settings at any time.</p>
